# Google Search Console Skills

Skills for analyzing Google Search Console data with Claude Code.

## What's Included

**gsc-analyzer** - Analyzes GSC exports to identify SEO opportunities, content gaps, and paid search targets. Classifies brand vs. non-brand traffic and estimates revenue impact.

## Installation

npx skills add coreyrab/gsc-skills
```

Or clone manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coreyrab/gsc-skills.git

## Usage

Export your data from Google Search Console (Performance → Export), then:

The skill will ask you to confirm brand terms before running analysis.
